# My Go Learning Journey
This repository documents my journey as a Senior Software Engineer transitioning from C++ to Go Backend. Here, you'll find code, projects, and exercises as I actively learn Go fundamentals, concurrency, and modern backend practices. My goal is to build a robust, hands-on portfolio of work to showcase my skills in Go. Feel free to provide feedback!
